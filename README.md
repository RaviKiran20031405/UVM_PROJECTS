Developing a reusable verification environment using UVM methodology to validate the functionality of the given design. The environment incorporates standard UVM components such as sequencer (SEQ), driver (DRV), monitor (MON), scoreboard (SCO), agent (AGENT), environment (ENV), and test (TEST). Communication between components is facilitated through TLM ports, with stimulus driven to the DUT via an interface and output data captured and compared against golden reference data in the scoreboard.
